## Crowdfunding for social causes through micro-donations

### PROBLEM
" The number of natural disasters and escalated conflicts has significantly increased over recent years. Financing from traditional sources is no longer sufficient to cover humanitarian relief operations, and funding gaps are reaching threatening levels.
Looking ahead, the widening gap between the number of affected people and sufficient resources will be the greatest challenge facing the humanitarian system.

For 2017, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimated that $23.5 billion in humanitarian funds would be necessary to support 101.2 million people in 37 countries. But, by mid-year, a mere $3.5 billion had been mobilized, leaving a frightful funding gap of $20.0 billion (85%) to be mobilized before the end of the year. In analyzing fundraising records from past years, it becomes evident that traditional fundraising is no longer sufficient. We need to radically change the way we fundraise for humanitarian relief aid, experimenting with and capitalizing on innovative fundraising methodologies. "
